# JVE-Portfolio

A hobby project where I build a portfolio for my girlfriend to use as a development portfolio for her study as well as a personal portfolio for storing and showcasing her works.

This is one of two projects. This is a React app used as the frontend for the entire project.

## Built with

* [![Vite][Vite.js]][Vite-url]
* [![Firebase][Firebase]][Firebase-url]
* [![Tailwind][TailwindCSS]][Tailwind-url]

React using Vite, styled using TailwindCSS and media stored using Firebase Storage.
